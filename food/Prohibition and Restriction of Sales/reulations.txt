2.1.17 Standard for Cheese and Cheese Products:
   - This Standard applies to Cheese, Processed Cheese and Processed Cheese Spreads as defined in the item 1 of this sub-regulation.

1. Description:
   - Cheese is the ripened or unripened soft, semi-hard, hard, or extra-hard product, which may be coated with food grade waxes or polyfilm, and in which the whey protein/ casein ratio does not exceed that of milk. Cheese is obtained by:
     - (i) Coagulating wholly or partly the protein of milk, skimmed milk, partly skimmed milk, cream, whey cream or buttermilk, or any combination of these materials, through the action of suitable enzymes of non-animal origin or other suitable coagulating agents, with or without use of harmless lactic acid bacteria and flavour producing bacteria, and by partially draining the whey resulting from the coagulation, while respecting the principle that cheese-making results in a concentration of milk protein (in particular, the casein portion), and that consequently the protein content of the cheese will be distinctly higher than the protein level of the blend of the above milk materials from which cheese was made;
     - (ii) Processing techniques involving coagulation of the protein of milk or products obtained from milk, or both, which give an end-product with similar physical, chemical and organoleptic characteristics as the product specified in entry (i) above.
