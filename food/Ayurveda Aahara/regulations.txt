*Should contain only the specified microorganism at the level claimed on the label. The counts have to
be determined using methodologyappropriate for the organisms, for example for Lactic acid bacteria ISO
15214/IS 16068, for Bifidobacteria ISO29981
Note.- In high value low volume (less than 100 g) and large retail pack (pack more than 1 kg)

or n number of samples to be taken from different sites of one large pack) accordingly on case to case
basis with the prior approval of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.
Stage where the Microbiological Standards shall apply.- The microbiological standards with respect
to the products categories specified as Process Hygiene Criteria indicate the acceptable functioningof
the production process. These are not to be used as requirements for releasing the products in the market.
These are indicative values above which corrective actions are required in order to maintain the hygiene
of the process in compliance with food law. These shall be applicable at the end of the manufacturing
process. The Microbiological Standards as Food Safety Criteria define the acceptability of a batch/lot and
shall be met in respect of the products at the end of the manufacturing process and the products in the
market during their shelf- life.
Action in case of unsatisfactory result.- In case of non-compliance in respect of process hygiene
criteria, the Food Business Operator shall.-
 check and improve process hygiene by implementation of guidelines in Schedule 4 of FSS
(Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations; and,
 ensure that all food safety criteria are complied with.

Sampling Plan and Guidelines
Guidelines for Regulator: The sampling for different microbiological standards specified in Table 1B
shall be ensured aseptically at manufacturing units and at retail points, as applicable, by a trained
person with specialized knowledge in the field of microbiology following guidelines in the Food
Safety and Standards (Food Products and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011 and ISO: 17728. The
samples shall be stored and transported in frozen condition at -18°C(±2°C) or under refrigerated
conditions at 2-5°C as applicable except for the products that are recommended to be stored at room
temperature by the manufacturer to enable initiation of analysis within twenty four hours of sampling.
Preservatives shall not be added to sample units intended for microbiological examination. The desired
number of sample units as per sampling plan given in Table 1B shall be taken from same batch or lot
and shall be submitted to the notified laboratories. Three sets, each containing ‘n’ number of samples (n
as defined in the sampling plan eg if n=5, then total no. of samples to be drawn is 15) shall be drawn.
Each of these three sets shall betested in three different accredited laboratories. The final decision shall
be based on the results of three accredited laboratories. In the case of Food Safety Criteria, the results
from all the three laboratories should indicate compliance with the specified criteria. There shall be no
provision for retesting or resampling for microbiological testing. The testing in laboratory shall be
ensured as per the methods given in the table “referencetest methods”
Guidelines for Food Business Operator: The Food Business Operator shall perform testing as
appropriate as per the microbiological standards specified in the Tables to these regulations above to
ensure verification of compliance with the microbiological requirements. The Food Business Operator
shall decide themselves subject to minimum prescribed under Food Safety and Standards (Licensing
and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulation,2011 , the necessary sampling and testing frequencies
to ensure compliance with the specified microbiological requirements. The Food Business Operator
may use analytical methods other than those described in “reference test methods” given below for inhouse testing only. However, these methods shall not be applicable for regulatory compliance purpose.
Sampling Plan:
The terms n,c,m and M used in this standard have the following meaning:
n = Number of units comprising a sample.
c = Maximum allowable number of units having microbiological counts above m for 2- class sampling
plan and between m and M for 3- class sampling plan.
m = Microbiological limit that separates unsatisfactory from satisfactory in a 2- class sampling plan or
acceptable from satisfactory in a 3-class sampling plan.
M = Microbiological limit that separates unsatisfactory from satisfactory in a 3-class sampling plan.
Interpretation of Results:
2-Class Sampling Plan
Satisfactory: If all the values observed are ≤ m.
Unsatisfactory: If one or more of the values observed are > m.
3-Class Sampling Plan
Satisfactory: If all the values observed are ≤ m.
Acceptable: If a maximum of c values are between m and M.
Unsatisfactory: If one or more of the values observed are > M, or if more than the prescribed number of c values are > m.


Reference test methods.- The following test methods shall be applied as reference methods. Test
methods prescribed in Food Safety and Standards Authority of India Manual of Method of Analysis of
Foods (Microbiological Testing) may also be referred along with the IS/ISO methods specified for
Process Hygiene Criteria and Food Safety Criteria. Latest version of test methods shall apply. In case
where an ISO method adopted by the BIS is specified (e.gIS XXXX / ISO YYYY), latest version of
the ISO method (or its BIS equivalent, if available) shall apply.

Aerobic Plate Count: The reference test method is the "Microbiology of the food chain -- Horizontal method for the enumeration of microorganisms -- Part 1: Colony count at 30 °C by the pour plate technique," referenced as IS 5402/ISO 4833.

Yeast and Mold Count: The test method for Yeast and Mold Count of Food Stuffs and Animal Feed is IS 5403. Additionally, there are specific methods:

For products with water activity greater than 0.95: "Microbiology of food and animal feeding stuff -- Horizontal method for the enumeration of yeasts and moulds -- Part 1: Colony count technique" (ISO 21527-1).
For products with water activity less than 0.95: "Microbiology of food and animal feeding stuff -- Horizontal method for the enumeration of yeasts and moulds -- Part 2: Colony count technique" (ISO 21527-2).
Enterobacteriaceae Count: The reference methods include:

"Microbiology - General Guidance for the Enumeration of Enterobacteriaceae without Resuscitation - MPN Technique and Colony-count Technique" (IS/ISO 7402).
"Microbiology of Food and Animal feeding stuff – Horizontal methods for the detection and enumeration of Enterobacteriaceae -- Part 2: Colony-count method" (ISO 21528-2).
