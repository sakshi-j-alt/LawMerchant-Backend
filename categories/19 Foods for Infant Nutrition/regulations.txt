16. Foods for Infants with Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM): This standard applies to food intended 
for the specific dietary management of disease or a condition of infants with specific inborn error(s) of 
metabolism. This food is intended to be given under medical supervision.
(1) Description:
(a) A food for infant with IEM is a food which is formulated or processed to be consumed orally or 
administered enterally through a tube and is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or a 
condition with distinctive nutritional requirements, based on well-established scientific principles, studies 
and medical evaluation.
(b) It is specially processed and formulated with nutrients desirable for the infant suffering from a specific 
IEM. The product shall exclude the ingredients/nutrients that are harmful to the diseased infant. The 
essential characteristic involves a specific modification of the content or nature of proteins, fats or 
carbohydrates.
(c) It is intended for the dietary management of an infant who, because of therapeutic or chronic needs has 
restricted, limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or infant 
formula or certain nutrients or who needs specific nutrients established by medical observations.
(d) Such foods fulfill unique nutritional needs of the infant with IEM through specific modifications or 
alterations and processing of the food components.
(e) The Food Authority shall specify the IEM conditions as approved by it after undertaking proper 
scientific evaluation. No food business operator shall manufacture, sell, market, or import products for IEM 
conditions except those specified by the Food Authority from time to time.
(2) Composition: 
(a) The composition of food for infants with IEM shall be based on sound medical and nutritional 
principles. The nutritional safety and adequacy of the food shall be scientifically demonstrated to support 
the growth and development of infants with IEM. Their use shall be demonstrated by scientific evidence to 
be beneficial in the dietary management of the infants for whom it is intended.
(b) Ingredients used in such food shall be suitable and safe and shall comply with all the applicable 
provisions of the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 
2011. The product may have ingredients such as milk, carbohydrates, vegetable oils, hydrolysed proteins, 
amino acids, or any other ingredients required for the infants with IEM provided they are safe, desirable 
and nutritionally beneficial for infants with IEM.
(c) The product may also have ingredients that are scientifically and medically proven to be necessary for 
such foods. However, prior approval of the authority has to be taken.
(d) It may contain vitamins and minerals stated in infant formula; provided such nutrients are safe, 
desirable and not harmful for infants suffering from IEM. Vitamins, minerals and amino acids for infants 
suffering from IEM may be added at levels greater than RDA specified based on scientific or medical needs 
and under strict medical supervision.
(3) Labelling: 
(a) The words ‘FOOD FOR SPECIAL MEDICAL PURPOSE’ shall be printed in capital and bold 
letters in the immediate proximity of the name or brand name of the product. 
(b) The statement “For the nutrition management of .................... (specific IEM disease(s) , disorder(s) 
or medical condition(s) for which the product is intended, and for which it has been shown to be 
effective)shall be appearing on the label. 
(c) An advisory warning “RECOMMENDED TO BE USED UNDER MEDICAL ADVICE ONLY” 
shall appearing on the label in capital and bold letters in an area separated from other written, printed or 
graphic information.
(d) Information on osmolality or osmolarity and/or acid-base balance shall be given when appropriate.
(e) Such foods in which essential characteristic involves a specific modification of the content or nature of 
proteins, fats or carbohydrates shall bear a description of this modification and information on the amino 
acid, fatty acid or carbohydrate profile when necessary.
